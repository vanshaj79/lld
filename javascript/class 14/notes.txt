what is a promise?
Assurance to my code that i will eventually do something which i may or may not do it.(eventual completion of a async task)

why we need Async-Await?
1- To avoid promise hell and callback hell we use Async-Await
when we want to perform some async operations in a sync/serial fashion and chain multiple operations.
