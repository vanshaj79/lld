1- Oops pillars
    polymorphism
    encapsulation
    abstraction

2- call,bind,apply
3- memory of object
   primitive & reference datatypes
   shallow copy & deep copy

CALL
The call method in javascript allows you to invoke a function on an object while providing a specific context(this value) 
for that function to use, along with optional arguments that the function can accept.
This enables dynamic context binding and the passing of specific values directly to the function being called.

APPLY 
Apply and call method are almost same. The only difference is, when we are using apply method, we need to pass an array as the argument.

BIND 
The bind method in JavaScript creates a new function that, when invoked, has a specific this value set to a provided value.
It is useful for "binding" a function to a particular object as its context. The new function produced by bind can also have preset arguments if provided.

SHALLOW COPY 
A shallow copy creates a new object or array, but the contents within it remain references to the original data.
it copies the top-level structure without recursively copying nested objects or arrays.

ABSTRACTION 
Abstraction means hiding certain details that don't matter to the user and only showing essential features or functions.

ENCAPSULATION 
Encapsulation means keeping properties and methods private inside a class, so that they are not accessible from outside that class.

POLYMORPHISM 
Polymorphism means having different and many forms. we can overwrite a method inherited from a parent class.
