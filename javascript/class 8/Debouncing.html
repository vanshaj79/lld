<!--Debouncing is a way to control the rate at which a function is executed 
using debouncing, a function is executed after certain period of inactivity.
It improves performance of your app-->

    // conventional way - whenever there is a script tag your HTMl parsing will block, it will first download your JS and executed your JS ,
    // once downloading and executing of js is done then it will continue your HTML parsing. overall laod time increases.
    
    // async - if we mention async in script tag, your HTML is rendering as soon as the script tag with async is encountered, the downloading has started in parallel with html rendering 
    // as soon as the downloading done it will start executing it (execution and rendering can't go parallel so rendering stops during execution)
    // once execution done, html parsing started again.
    // overall loading time slightly reduced

    // defer - if we mention defer in script tag, html parsing going on as soon as you encountered the script tag with defer, it will start downloading in parallel and 
    // it will first complete the html parsing then after it will execute.
    // overall loading time get reduces (most efficient way bcz html parsing is much fast as compare to async)
